## Installation

Download the repo and throw it into the Arduino/libraries folder, then simply add whichever driver you need

## Supported Modes

Binary output through a given number of pins acting as a single parallel output port

74LS47 4bit 7Segment decoder Integrated Circuit

74LS138 3bit 1-8 demultiplexer (A simple BitOutPins<3> would suffice)

## Usage

Refer to the examples and /docs for in-depth info
